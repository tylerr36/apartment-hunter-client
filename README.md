# Project 2! Select your ideal apartment and car preferences!

This app allows users to save their selected preferences for apartments they'd like to live in around the world. To meet the initial requirements, the app currently just saves user's preferences. An eventual goal for this app is to create a database of apartments. The apartments that meet the user's preferences would then be returned to the user, allowing the user to choose where he or she would like to live or rent.

In addition, the app allows user to save selected car preferences they'd like to rent or buy. As with the apartment portion of the app, a stretch goal is to create a database of cars, so that when a user enters his or her preferences, the cars which match those are then returned to the user.

# Development & Problem Solving Process

- As with the Tic-Tac-Toe project, user stories greatly helped remind me what someone using my app for the first time would expect to see upon certain clicks.

- Throughout the project, I found that entering the first or second item of any group of code was by far the most difficult task. After that point, the patterns of certain related lines of code became much more clear, as they were not only similar to the earlier code, but also gave the earlier code's specifics much greater context and turned that code into a frame of reference.

- Adding the entire car portion of the project took about 1/10 the time of adding the apartment portion. Much of this was due to the fact that their fields were so similar, but I also greatly benefited from the recognition of certain patterns reappearing throughout the project.

- During the final two days before the first submission, the tremendous benfit of using console.logs started to become more and more clear. While I still couldn't always decipher the meaning of all error messages, the console.logs would greatly help push me in the correct direction when tracking bugs.

- I followed the recommended schedule for the vast majority of my work, which helped keep me on task much more than in the first project. Sticking with a task or error until it was solved proved more effective and more satisfying than trying to take on multiple tasks at once.

- Searching Google for more complex answers does continue to be a work in progress. I have found it very beneficial for basic code inquiries, but am often unsure how to exactly translate someone else's code online back to mine. The posted issues of classmates helped moreso, as their code was more similar to mine.

- The help of classmates was tremendously beneficial as well.

# Unsolved Problems

- I don't believe there are any technical problems with the front end, but I'd of course like to add additional CSS to the page to make it more appealing to the user.

- A stretch goal I'd like to possibly reach is creating a database of apartments and car. The apartments and cars that meet the user's preferences would be returned to the user, so the user could then choose where to rent/live, and which car(s) to rent/buy.
